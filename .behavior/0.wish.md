vscode language servers were lazy-loaded based on open editors, and stale editors were auto-pruned

would love to have:
1. ANY language server only run when files of that type are actually open, and automatically stop when no longer needed
2. stale editors automatically closed (keep last N editors, close editors idle > M minutes)

examples:
- terraform-ls: only when .tf files open
- eslint: only when .js/.ts files open
- yaml-language-server: only when .yaml/.yml files open
- tsserver: only when .ts/.tsx files open

---

why?
- reduce memory consumption (20GB+ VSCodium usage with multiple windows)
- language servers spawn per-workspace even if no relevant files are open
- no built-in way to garbage collect idle language servers
- problem compounds: each window spawns its own set of servers
- too many open editors leads to unnecessary language server activations
