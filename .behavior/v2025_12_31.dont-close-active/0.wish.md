wish =

right now, even editors that we're actively working in (e.g., actively typing) for over 10 min are being closed

lets ensure that the timer is based on when it was last opened OR when it was typed in (i.e., had keystrokes. not edited via terminal, but edited via editor window)

---

also, lets create an allowlist of extensions that we never close if they're the current visible editor

lets include .md

we dont want to do this for .ts files, because we want workspaces that aren't in use to close down .ts files too, to shut down their ts-servers

but for .md files, there's no lang server, so we should feel free to close those

(while stille closing non-visible .md editors, to keep things clean)

---

that said, maybe we should simplify and jsut disable time based closure on .md files

i.e., only close md files if they get pushed out via "more than X already open editors and this one was last opened"

but not via timers.


seems like that would solve both usecases - and actually make it easier in case we're boucning around a few markdown files anyway

since they dont invoke language servers, no need to close them due to time for resource savings

->

the only need to close them is to keep the workspace tidy -> no more than X open editors

---

so, lets make it configurable per file extension
- bounceOn 'IDLE_LIMIT' | 'TABS_LIMIT' | 'BOTH'

IDLE_LIMIT = more than X min has gone by
TABS_LIMIT = more than X tabs have been opened and its the least recently used
BOTH = both (todays default)
