wish =

upon open of a vscode workspace, when bhouncer initializes, it would stop stealing the bottom panel's focus into the output

i.e., today

i open a workspace

i open the terminal

i start typing

and in the middle of typing, bhouncer initializes, the output pane of the bottom nav steals focus (away from the terminal i was typing in)

thats awful

stop it plz; halp
